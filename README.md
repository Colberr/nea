# NEA Vectors
## Drawing lines and planes
**r** = A general point on the line or plane
### Line
**r** = **a**+&lambda;**b**, where **a** is a known point on the line and **b** is the directional vector
### Plane
**r**.**n** = **a**.**n**, where **a** is a known point on the plane and **n** is the direction of the normal to the plane
## Other Features
### Import/ Export
You can import lines, planes and points by pasting them into the import box (e.g.: `[{"id":"l000","format":"lineAB","values":[-3,-1,-3,2,1,2]},{"id":"p000","format":"planeAN","values":[3,1,1,-3,1,2]},{"id":"x000","format":"pointCol","values":[-1,1,1]}]`). You can also export equations you have made.
